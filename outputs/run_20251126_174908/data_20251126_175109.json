MI utilizes machine learning to model, predict, and optimize \nthe properties of new materials.1,2 Naturally, the most essential resource in MI is data. Hence, \nsignificant efforts have been made to develop open databases for inorganic materials and light-\nweight organic molecules, such as the Materials Project3 (~140,000 inorganic compounds), the \nAutomatic-Flow4 (AFLOW: ~3,000,000 inorganic compounds), the Open Quantum Materials \nDatabase5 (OQMD: ~1,000,000 inorganic compounds), and QM96 (~134,000 organic molecules). \nIn particular, the huge databases of computational properties built using high-throughput first-\n3 \n \nprinciples calculations have brought remarkable progress in MI and their widespread use in \nscience and technology. However, for polymeric materials, despite their industrial usefulness and \nunique characteristics, such as lightness, high tenacity, elasticity, and ease of processing, the \ndevelopment of open databases has considerably lagged behind other material systems.7 This is \ndue to the following reasons: (1) high costs of data production, (2) the difficulty in creating \ncommon data due to the diversity of polymeric materials in terms of structures and processing \nconditions, and (3) cultural barriers to avoiding information leakage to competitors.2 In addition, \nthe computational difficulty in performing high-throughput calculations and their high \ncomputational costs have hindered the development of computational property databases for \npolymeric materials. \nPoLyInfo8 is the current largest database of polymer properties, built from manually collected \nliterature data. Currently, it contains approximately 100 properties of more than 18,000 polymers. \nHowever, the overall data in PoLyInfo are rather sparse as there are few cases where more than \none property is simultaneously recorded for one polymer.

The calculated dataset is provided in the Supporting Information.

In the validation \nprocess, we used the 1,001 polymers for which the automatic calculation was successfully \ncompleted at least thrice out of the five independent trials. The calculated density well reproduced \nthe experimental values (R2 = 0.890), albeit with a slight underestimation, as the slope of the fitted \nstraight line in the parity plot was equal to 0.805 in Figure 4(a). The standard deviation (SD) of \nthe calculated values in the five independent trials was low. The slight underestimation may be \nexplained that, since the polymerization degree in our MD calculations was smaller than that in \nthe experimental values from PoLyInfo, a mobility of polymer chains in the MD calculations was \nlarger than that in the experimental values, resulting in a slight overestimation of free volume in \nthe MD calculations. As reported in a previous study, the MD calculation of the density of the \n19 \n \norganic molecule liquids using the GAFF2 force field is often poorly performed in high-density \nregions.62 On the other hand, in our calculation, such a discrepancy never occurred in the high-\ndensity regions. This is because of the use of the modified force field parameters developed by \nTr\u00e4g and Zahn47 for fluorocarbon polymers.  \nThe calculated thermal conductivities also showed good agreement with the experimental \nvalues in PoLyInfo (R2 = 0.490), as shown in Figure 4(b).

Since the contribution of the improper term was negligible, it is shown as a \ndihedral term in Figure 7. Notably, the AMBER-type force field describes the dihedral potential \nas the sum of the dihedral term and nonbonded 1\u20134 interactions; thus, a part of the nonbonded \ncontribution is essentially attributed to the dihedral contribution.30 \n \nFigure 7.

The high-throughput calculation \nusing RadonPy was successfully performed for more than 1,000 unique amorphous polymers with \na wide variety of thermophysical properties, such as the thermal conductivity, refractive index, \n30 \n \ndensity, and specific heat capacity CP. For systems other than amorphous homopolymers, such as \ncopolymers, blend polymers, and uniaxially oriented systems, as well as for other properties, \nautomated calculation capabilities have already been implemented; however, no calculation \nprotocols based on experimental data have been established. In RadonPy, automatic calculation \nprotocols for various polymer properties can be implemented as an add-on feature. We will \ncontinue to promote the development of RadonPy. \nIn this study, the agreement between a total of six properties obtained from the high-throughput \nMD calculation and experimental values was comprehensively verified. As a result, the refractive \nindex, density, and thermal conductivity successfully reproduced the experimental values \nquantitatively. The calculated values of the specific heat capacity were also highly correlated with \nthe experimental values, although the classical MD calculation had a systematic bias due to its \ninability to represent quantum effects. For the linear and volumetric expansion coefficients, the \ncorrelation between the calculated and experimental values was weak due to large variations and \nuncertainties in both the calculations and experiments. There has been no previous work on a \ncomprehensive validation of high-throughput MD simulations of polymer properties on such a \nscale.
